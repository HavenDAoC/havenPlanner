# HavenDAoC Planner

This project is intended to provide players with the means of planning out their Dark Age of Camelot (DAoC) character specializations from a web-based interface. The basis of this tool is to provide an accurate representation of a freeshard's server settings so that a player might accurately view and plan character progression.

The Planner website is based upon the efforts of the Uthgard-based genuapp, which may be found at: http://www.genuapp.appspot.com/char/index.html. Like the website this planner is based upon, the settings reflected in this project are based upon the v1.65 patch version of DAoC.

The HavenDAoC Planner is currently considered "under development," as changes are being actively made to improve the overall functionality of the website.

## Running the Website

In order to utilize this tool, you need only copy/paste these repo files to a desired directory and open the `index.html` page. This will launch the website from which you may actively interact with the planner.
